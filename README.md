SurgeShield

AI-driven hospital surge forecasting and autonomous operational response system.

SurgeShield is designed to help hospitals prepare for patient surges caused by festivals, pollution spikes, seasonal respiratory waves, or epidemic outbreaks. The system predicts upcoming admission loads using a hybrid machine learning pipeline and automatically generates operational response plans for staffing, supplies, bed allocation and patient advisories.

This project was built end-to-end within a constrained execution window for hackathon demonstration purposes.

Key Capabilities

Forecasts patient admissions 7–30 days ahead based on historical patterns, pollution trends and event-based risk factors.

Uses a hybrid model combining:

Time-series learning for baseline volume prediction.

Gradient-boosting based risk uplift modelling for event-based surge impact.

Automatically generates recommendations across four domains:

Staff allocation

Medical supply inventory planning

Bed and ICU capacity preparation

Patient advisory generation

Maintains a full operational audit log of alerts and AI-triggered actions.

Presents forecasts, department-wise load distribution, AQI correlation, insights and surge risk indicators via a web interface.
